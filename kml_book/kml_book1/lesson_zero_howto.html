  <h1>🧭 How to Proceed with KML</h1>

  <p>This is not just about remembering — it’s about <strong>seeing</strong>.  
  Seeing rhythm, emotion, and structure — and letting your hand remember what your eyes have seen and your heart has felt.</p>

  <h2>1. Watch the Stroke Story</h2>
  <p>Begin each lesson by watching the <strong>stroke-order animation</strong>.  
  Notice how each line appears — the direction, balance, and pause between strokes.  
  Don’t rush. Let the motion imprint itself as a rhythm, not just a shape.</p>

  <h2>2. Feel the Emotion Through the Emoji</h2>
  <p>Every kanji in KML carries an <strong>emoji companion</strong> — a spark of emotion or imagery that connects the abstract to the familiar.  
  Take a moment to sense what it evokes: joy, calm, danger, life, time.  
  Memory begins where emotion starts.</p>

  <h2>3. Close Your Eyes — Can You Still “See” It?</h2>
  <p>Once you’ve watched and felt the kanji, close your eyes.  
  Can you still see the flow of strokes? The emoji’s emotion? The story behind it?  
  That’s where true visual memory begins to form.</p>

  <h2>4. Trace with Your Finger</h2>
  <p>Now trace the character slowly with your finger or stylus, following the animation’s order.  
  Build your <strong>muscle memory</strong> step by step — not for perfection, but for fluency.  
  The goal is for the kanji to one day <em>flow off your hand</em> without thought.</p>

  <h2>5. Write Like a Beginner, See Like an Artist</h2>
  <p>In the beginning, write with the focus of a first grader.  
  It’s not childish — it’s training your hand to move with awareness.  
  Once your form feels steady, allow natural expressiveness to emerge.  
  <strong>You are an adult learner</strong>, which means you bring a sense of beauty and intention to every stroke.</p>

  <h2>6. One Reading, Naturally Absorbed</h2>
  <p>Each kanji is introduced with just <strong>one key reading</strong>.  
  Don’t force memorization — let repetition and exposure do their quiet work.  
  Meaning first, then sound. Let language come alive naturally.</p>

  <h2>✍️ Bonus: Try Your Stroke in the Wild</h2>
  <p>After a few finger or paper repetitions, explore how it behaves outside the lesson:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a brush pen and feel the resistance of real ink.</li>
    <li>Or open <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Translate</a>, switch to Japanese input mode, and click the ✍️ icon to draw your kanji.</li>
    <li>See if AI can recognize it — and if not, adjust your balance or order until it does.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This playful feedback loop sharpens your awareness of what truly defines a kanji’s identity.</p>
(fix later)
  🌻＋🪵 (on high table) ⇒ 🌻
Rule: When a kanji is reused as a component, we keep only its main symbol (🌻) to represent its meaning or feeling.
Example: 卓 (🌻＋🪵) → 朝 (🌻＋🌙)

  <p><em>You are not just copying symbols — you are retracing thought, rhythm, and memory left by centuries of writers before you.</em></p>
