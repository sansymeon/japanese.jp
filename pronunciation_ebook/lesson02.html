  <h1>Lesson 2: R vs L – Two Sounds Japanese Already Know (But Never Separate)</h1>

  <p>If you're Japanese, you already know how to make both R and L. You just don’t know you know.</p>
  <p>That’s because the Japanese ラ行 (ra, ri, ru, re, ro) is very similar to “L.” The only difference is, the English “L” is even softer, faster, and more neutral.</p>

  <p>If only the missionaries who started teaching English in Japan 150 years ago had explained that the Japanese ラ行 sounds closer to a "soft D" in English… who knows? Maybe Japanese learners today would be speaking English with much greater confidence—just like many of their neighbors in Asia!</p>

  <p>Let’s start by flipping the classroom. Pretend you’re teaching English speakers how to pronounce Japanese. Tell them to softly say: <strong>“Da, Di, Du, De, Do.”</strong></p>

  <p>Perfect! You’ve now become a qualified Japanese pronunciation coach!</p>

  <p>Now ask them to say:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>adigato</li>
    <li>yodoshiku</li>
    <li>dingo</li>
    <li>mudasaki</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Does it sound like a Japanese “R”? Exactly. That’s the technique we’ll use in this book: use sounds from your native language to approximate sounds in the target language.</p>

  <p>You may say, “Wait a minute! ラ行 is not the same as タ行!” Good catch—you’re absolutely right. But we’re not aiming for exactness. We’re aiming for <strong>comfortably close</strong>.</p>

  <p>In fact, in American English, the Japanese “R” is surprisingly close to the sound in “water.” Most Americans don’t pronounce the “T” in “water” as a crisp T, but as a soft, fast D—something very close to ラ.</p>

  <p>So when teaching English speakers to say ラ, we use that soft D. It’s technically “wrong,” but it’s <em>a thousand times better</em> than using a hard American “R.”</p>

  <h2>Now Let’s Reverse It</h2>

  <p>You’ll learn how to pronounce the English “R” using sounds you already know. No stress!</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Understand English "R"</h3>
  <p>Start by pronouncing “U.” Notice what your tongue does: nothing. Perfect. That’s what we want.</p>
  <p>This is the <strong>rehabilitation phase</strong> of pronunciation. Learn to pronounce “R” <strong>without using your tongue</strong>.</p>

  <p>You might say:</p>
  <blockquote>“But that’s not what my teacher taught! That’s not what NHK says!”</blockquote>

  <p>And you're right. You’ve probably been taught a very complicated, hyper-correct way to pronounce “R.” But let’s be honest: that version sounds like a professor demonstrating difficulty—or a flight attendant trying to sound textbook-perfect.</p>

  <p>If that’s your goal, you may want to consider learning Chinese instead. That kind of "R" is very useful there.</p>

  <p>But in English? We use a much softer, tongue-relaxed version.</p>

  <p>The English “R” can be approximated with a <strong>U</strong> sound! With lips slightly puckered like a kiss, and the tongue floating—<em>not touching anything</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Red → Ued (or Wed)</li>
    <li>Right → Uait (or White)</li>
    <li>Run → Uan (or Wan / Won)</li>
    <li>Radio → Uedio (or Way-dio)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now you’ve got the “R.” <strong>Congu-atulations!</strong></p>

  <h3>Step 2: Master "L"</h3>
  <p>R and L are totally different in English:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>L</strong> = Tongue touches the top of your mouth (like singing “la-la-la”)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> = Lips pucker, tongue floats — don’t let it touch anything!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The L sound is soft and lyrical, kind of like the Japanese ラ, but imagine it even gentler.</p>

  <h4>Practice with Song</h4>
  <p>Think: <em>Sister Act choir practice</em>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>la〜la〜la〜la〜la〜</li>
    <li>li〜li〜li〜li〜li〜</li>
    <li>lu〜lu〜lu〜lu〜lu〜</li>
    <li>le〜le〜le〜le〜le〜</li>
    <li>lo〜lo〜lo〜lo〜lo〜</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you’re really singing gently, and not tapping your tongue like a soft D, then you’re doing it right.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lemon → レモン</li>
    <li>Light → ライト</li>
    <li>Love → ラ〜ブ (but soft, not loud)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tip">
    <h3>Common Confusion Pairs: Test Yourself</h3>
    <p>Try saying both out loud. Can you feel the difference?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice / Lice</li>
      <li>Light / Right</li>
      <li>Lead / Read</li>
      <li>Fly / Fry</li>
      <li>Tom & Jerry / Peanut Butter & Jelly</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>That’s your R and L warmup. You’re no longer a beginner—you’re a recovering textbook speaker, entering the world of real sounds.</p>
